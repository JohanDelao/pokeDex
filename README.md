# PokeDex

Hello All Who Are Reading!

This project is something that connects with my childhood as I am using the PokeAPI (found here: https://pokeapi.co/) to create a PokeDex web application! The fully-completed
application will have the following features:
<li>Display pokemon from the API, each Pokemon will display its name, picture, and type of Pokemon it is.</li>
<li>Search functionality, in which the user can type into the search bar and whichever Pokemon's names contain that phrase it will display</li>
<li>Side-Menu (With some subtle animations) that will contain the different type of Pokemon, when a type is pressed, the Pokemon of that type will display</li>
<li>Hopefully bring childhood memories!</li>
